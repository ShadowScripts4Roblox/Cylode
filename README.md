My Anti-Virus / Windows Defender keeps deleting Cylode.
------------------------------------------------------------

Antiviruses usually mistake Roblox exploits as viruses due to their nature. Most if not all modern Roblox exploits work by injecting some sort of dll file into Roblox and running Lua code (Scripts) in the environment it creates.

Dll injection isn't just used by game cheats. They are also used by malware. Due to this antivirus applications try to quarantine/delete all dll injectors they detect without actually knowing if they are safe or not. You will usually see your antivirus calling most exploits including Cylode a Cryptinject.msr trojan because of this. 


To fix this, disable "Real-Time Protection" in your Anti-Virus / Windows Defender
