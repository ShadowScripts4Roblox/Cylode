A new beginning in ROBLOX exploits.
Free, completely keyless.

- - - 

What is Cylode?
===============

Cylode is a ROBLOX executor that is completely free, without a key. It has clean and polished UI that is easy on the eyes, and it provides you with a great and fun exploiting experience!


Can I get banned for using Cylode?
===================================

Cylode doesn't usually get detected, and has systems to prevent detection, but it is never impossible.
Since this is an exploit, you should expect getting detections in some cases.



What do I need to run Cylode on my Computer?
============================================

The webclient version of Roblox which you can get here: www.roblox.com/download
A 64-bit installation of Windows 10 (or Windows 11): https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
.NET Framework 4.7.2+ : https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net472-web-installer
VC Redist x64  : https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
VC Redist x86 : https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe
The Cylode cInstaller


My Anti-Virus / Windows Defender keeps deleting Cylode.
======================================================

Antiviruses usually mistake Roblox exploits as viruses due to their nature. Most if not all modern Roblox exploits work by injecting some sort of dll file into Roblox and running Lua code (Scripts) in the environment it creates.

Dll injection isn't just used by game cheats. They are also used by malware. Due to this antivirus applications try to quarantine/delete all dll injectors they detect without actually knowing if they are safe or not. You will usually see your antivirus calling most exploits including Cylode a Cryptinject.msr trojan because of this. 


To fix this, disable "Real-Time Protection" in your Anti-Virus / Windows Defender
